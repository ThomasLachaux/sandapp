# Server A

This directory is for the code and documentation of the _server A_. A starter Dockerfile has been added, it has some comments to get you started.

For communicating with RabbitMQ, there are many possible approaches. In the `rabbit-utils`-directory, in _receiveTask.js_ and _sendTask.js_ files, you can see simple examples of code that can be integrated into Swagger server stub's `Order`-controller. These have been directly copied from RabbitMQ examples, and can be improved a lot for this system.
